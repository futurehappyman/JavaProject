# JavaProject

Project overview.

Project choie explanation. 

I got into programming recently so I am still thinking of the ways to improve what I do, but initially I wanted to build things for people who live in the Internet,I wanted to make their life easier and more productive. Therefore the project I chose is the management system for the shop, the system to control the backwards of the program, I am currently not familiar with GUIs that java provides, so I only built the backwards of the program with all OOP concepts. It is a quite simple project, but extremely useful if you further develop it. 

Competitor analysis.

My project is an extremely minor thing in comparison to everyone else in the real industry as I donâ€™t use any cycles of development, but you can absolutely develop the project in any way you would like like to, for example, make the frontend, connect to db, or any other thing you would like, it has agility. Potential strategy for my project: making the feature to show only sustainable products. 

Demostration of OOP skills.

All the OOP concepts were used, additionally they are documented in the project. Inheritance: calss Manager serves as a Base class fort CustomerManager and AdminMAnager classes, these calsses inherit the fileds and the functionality. Polymorphism: displayProducts method is overriden in different classes to provide common functionality.
Encapsulation: key variables are kept private - productName, removeProductName, productForCart, e.t.c access is managed through methods. methods like addproduct, removeproduct , and those that are used in the SystemPanel class are the the one making the SystemPanel abstratc and black boxed. Abnstraction: MAnager class serves as an abstraction with key fields for the proiduct , like ProductCounter and listOfProducts, and it has method with polimoirphic behavior.

Technology stack. 

i have't choose any extra tecno, its common fileWriter to keep the products logged i would say and the basic collections, like arraylist and hashmap, used the, because they were the core for my programm.
Industry relevance.
Target is the e-commerce.
Real world problem addressed: 
managing the product inventory, customer interactions and admin interactions. 

Project Reflection and conclusion.

Summary of the development process: 
All OOP concepts were implemented, the focus was on clear and concise code that is reusable, initial thought process was like: build somewhere the function, hide it, use it somewhere, i integrates a lot of input validations, made sure the programm doese not stop without a serious reason. 

Challanges faced, the architecture is quite bad, should hgave been more detailed when i just started building, because the more i wrote the more sophisticated it were to then create and implement something new. 

Lessons learned: 
OOP programming, proper input validation.

Future improvements: 
make better loggining the product in the file, making the prices, search methods, GUI potenially, databases.
