# JavaProject

Project overview.

Project choie explanation. 

I got into programming recently so I am still thinking of the ways to improve what I do, but initially I wanted to build things for people who live in the Internet,I wanted to make their life easier and more productive. Therefore the project I chose is the management system for the shop, the system to control the backwards of the program, I am currently not familiar with GUIs that java provides, so I only built the backwards of the program with all OOP concepts. It is a quite simple project, but extremely useful if you further develop it. 

Competitor analysis.

My project is an extremely minor thing in comparison to everyone else in the real industry as I donâ€™t use any cycles of development, but you can absolutely develop the project in any way you would like like to, for example, make the frontend, connect to db, or any other thing you would like, it has agility. Potential strategy for my project: making the feature to show only sustainable products. 

Demostration of OOP skills.

All the OOP concepts were used, additionally they are documented in the project. Incapsulation
